$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Output

Completed implementation planning for the ROS 2 educational module. The planning process included:

1. Technical context definition with specific technology choices (Python 3.10, ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill)
2. Constitution check to ensure alignment with project principles
3. Project structure definition for the documentation module
4. Phase 0 research to resolve unknowns about Python version, ROS distribution, testing methodology, etc.
5. Phase 1 design including data models, quickstart guide, and content interface specifications
6. Agent context update to include ROS 2 specific information

The plan is complete and ready for the task breakdown phase.
