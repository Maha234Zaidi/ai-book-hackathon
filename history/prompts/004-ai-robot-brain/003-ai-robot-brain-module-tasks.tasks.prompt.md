## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated the tasks.md file for the AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) module. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. The structure includes:

1. Phase 1: Setup (shared infrastructure) - 5 tasks
2. Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites) - 6 tasks
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learn NVIDIA Isaac Fundamentals (Priority: P1) - 7 tasks
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Implement Photorealistic Simulation (Priority: P2) - 7 tasks
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Implement Visual SLAM and Navigation (Priority: P2) - 8 tasks
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Implement Path Planning with Nav2 (Priority: P3) - 8 tasks
7. Phase 7: User Story 5 - Apply Best Practices and Integration (Priority: P3) - 9 tasks
8. Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns - 7 tasks

Each task follows the required checklist format with ID, story label (where applicable), and specific file paths. The tasks are designed to meet all requirements from the feature specification including technical accuracy, educational clarity, reproducibility, consistency, safety & ethics, source verification, and Docusaurus compatibility.
