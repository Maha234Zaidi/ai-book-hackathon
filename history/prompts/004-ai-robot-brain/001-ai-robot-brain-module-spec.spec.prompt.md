## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I have successfully completed the feature specification for the NVIDIA Isaac AI-Robot Brain module:

**Branch Name**: `004-ai-robot-brain`
**Spec File Path**: `C:\\Users\\tcp\\Desktop\\physical-ai-book\\specs\\004-ai-robot-brain\\spec.md`
**Checklist Results**: All quality criteria have been validated and met
**Readiness**: The specification is ready for the next phase (`/sp.plan`)

The specification includes:
- Comprehensive user scenarios with prioritized stories
- Detailed functional requirements covering all aspects of the NVIDIA Isaac module
- Measurable success criteria focused on learning outcomes
- Identified key entities related to the robotics technologies
- Quality validation checklist confirming completeness

The specification addresses all the requirements from the original feature description, structuring the content for a complete Module 3 on the AI-Robot Brain using NVIDIA Isaac technologies, with sections covering Isaac Sim & ROS, photorealistic simulation, VSLAM and navigation, path planning with Nav2, and best practices for integration.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for AI-Robot Brain module with NVIDIA Isaac technologies
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented all required sections from the feature description
