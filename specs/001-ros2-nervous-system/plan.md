# Implementation Plan: Robotic Communication Systems Education Module

**Branch**: `001-ros2-nervous-system` | **Date**: 2025-12-09 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the development of an educational module focused on robotic communication systems, specifically using ROS 2 as an example of middleware for humanoid robots. The module will cover fundamental concepts such as nodes, topics, services, and robot modeling (URDF), while connecting these to AI agent control patterns. The content will be designed to be technically accurate, educationally clear, and structured for optimal RAG retrieval.

The approach includes 4-5 chapters that build foundational knowledge (ROS 2 as robotic nervous system) through practical concepts (nodes, topics, services) to advanced applications (AI agents controlling robots and robot modeling). Each chapter will be 800-1500 words with conceptual code examples that don't require actual ROS installation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.8+ (to match ROS 2 compatibility)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus for documentation generation, Python (rclpy for code examples)
**Storage**: File-based Markdown content in the repository
**Testing**: Content validation with automated checks for formatting, technical accuracy, and RAG-readiness
**Target Platform**: Static web site generated by Docusaurus, deployable to GitHub Pages
**Project Type**: Educational content (single - book content for Docusaurus site)
**Performance Goals**: Fast build times, quick RAG retrieval, consistent rendering across browsers
**Constraints**:
- Content must be RAG-friendly (properly chunked and structured)
- No external installation required for learning (conceptual examples only)
- Must align with book constitution principles (technical accuracy, educational clarity)
- Word count: 800-1500 words per chapter
**Scale/Scope**:
- 4-5 chapters for this module
- Target audience: Students with basic Python but no robotics background
- Module should take 1 week to complete (4-6 hours per chapter)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book Constitution:

- ✅ Technical Accuracy: All robotics, AI, ROS 2 content will be correct and verifiable
- ✅ Educational Clarity: Writing style suitable for students learning robotics concepts
- ✅ Modularity: Content will be divided into clear modules matching quarter structure
- ✅ Reproducibility: Examples will be executable and testable (with conceptual code)
- ✅ Consistency: Terminology and formatting will remain consistent across chapters
- ✅ Safety & Ethics: Responsible AI and robotics practices will be highlighted

- ✅ Source Verification: Factual claims will refer to credible sources (ROS docs, research papers, etc.)
- ✅ RAG Alignment: All text will be chunkable and structured for optimal retrieval
- ✅ Documentation Format: Content will be Docusaurus-compatible Markdown with proper navigation

### Supporting Files

```text

├── sidebars.js                           # Navigation structure

```

**Structure Decision**: The content will be organized in a single, flat structure within a dedicated module directory. This follows the Docusaurus documentation pattern and supports the modularity requirement from the constitution. The structure allows for clear navigation while maintaining separation between different learning modules.
