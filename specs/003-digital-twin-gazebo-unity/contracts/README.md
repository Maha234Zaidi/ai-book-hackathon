# Contracts Directory

This directory is included as part of the standard project structure, but for the Digital Twin educational module, there are no traditional API contracts to define.

This module focuses on educational content creation covering Gazebo physics simulation and Unity rendering for digital twins. Rather than defining API contracts, the deliverable is comprehensive documentation with:

1. Code examples and snippets for Gazebo/ROS 2 integration
2. Unity setup and configuration tutorials
3. Hands-on exercises for students
4. Best practices for combining physics simulation with visualization

The interfaces for this module are educational rather than programmatic, focusing on:
- How to set up the necessary tools and environments
- How to create and use URDF models in Gazebo
- How to create compatible visual models in Unity
- How to synchronize state between simulation and visualization
