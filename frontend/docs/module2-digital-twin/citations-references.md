# Citation and Reference System

This module follows a consistent citation and reference system to ensure all information is properly attributed to official sources and maintain academic integrity.

## Citation Format

All sources should be cited using the IEEE format. In-text citations should appear as [1], [2], etc., with full references listed in the References section at the end of each document.

### Example In-Text Citation:
> "Gazebo provides physics simulation that is essential for digital twin systems [1]."

## Reference Sections

Each document in this module should end with a "References" section:

```

## Citing Code Examples

When referencing specific code examples or API functions, cite the precise documentation page:

> The ROS 2 publisher-subscriber model is implemented as shown in [4]:

[4] ROS 2 Documentation, "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber," 2025. [Online]. Available: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html. [Accessed: Dec. 9, 2025].

## Best Practices

1. **Verify Sources**: Always verify citations lead to accurate information
2. **Update Citations**: Update citations if documentation URLs change
3. **Use Direct Links**: Link directly to the specific documentation page
4. **Include Access Dates**: Always include access dates for online sources
5. **Distinguish Versions**: Specify software versions when relevant
6. **Maintain Consistency**: Use the same citation style throughout the module
