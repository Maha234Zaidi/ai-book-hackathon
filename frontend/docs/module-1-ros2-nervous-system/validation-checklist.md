# Chapter Quality Assurance Checklist

Use this checklist to validate each chapter in the Robotic Communication Systems module before finalizing.

## Content Requirements

- [ ] Chapter addresses the learning objectives specified in the module overview
- [ ] All content is suitable for students with Python knowledge but no robotics background
- [ ] Technical concepts are accurately represented
- [ ] Content is between 800-1500 words as specified in the requirements
- [ ] All claims can be verified against official ROS 2 documentation
- [ ] No external installations required for learning (conceptual examples only)

## Formatting & Structure

- [ ] Chapter follows the proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, etc.)
- [ ] All code examples include language specification in triple backticks
- [ ] Code examples follow Python PEP8 standards
- [ ] All technical terms are defined when first introduced
- [ ] Cross-references to related concepts are properly linked
- [ ] All figures and diagrams are referenced properly in the text

## Educational Quality

- [ ] Content follows the writing conventions specified in the module guidelines
- [ ] Analogies are used to explain complex concepts where appropriate
- [ ] Examples are practical and relatable to students
- [ ] Key concepts are clearly explained before being applied
- [ ] The chapter builds knowledge progressively from simple to complex

## RAG Optimization

- [ ] Chapter structure follows RAG-friendly content guidelines
- [ ] Each section is semantically self-contained
- [ ] Headings are descriptive and meaningful for content chunking
- [ ] Paragraphs are limited to 4-6 sentences for optimal chunking
- [ ] Important concepts are clearly marked for retrieval

## Technical Accuracy

- [ ] All ROS 2 concepts are accurately represented
- [ ] rclpy examples follow current ROS 2 conventions
- [ ] URDF concepts are correctly explained
- [ ] All terminology is consistent with the module glossary
- [ ] References to official documentation are provided where appropriate

## Consistency

- [ ] Terminology is consistent with the module glossary
- [ ] Formatting follows the writing conventions document
- [ ] Cross-references follow the same format throughout the module
- [ ] Code example style is consistent with other chapters
- [ ] All sections include proper attribution if citing external sources

## Final Review

- [ ] Chapter has been proofread for clarity and correctness
- [ ] All links and references work correctly
- [ ] Code examples are syntactically correct (if implemented)
- [ ] Chapter integrates well with other chapters in the module
- [ ] Independent test criteria for the chapter's user story are met
