# Introduction to Robotic Communication Systems

Welcome to the Robotic Communication Systems Education Module. This module provides a comprehensive introduction to how robots communicate and coordinate their actions, with a focus on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as an example of middleware for humanoid robots.

## Module Overview

This module covers fundamental concepts such as:
- The importance of communication in robotic systems
- Core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services, and parameters
- How AI agents can interface with robot controllers
- Robot modeling using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

Each chapter builds upon the previous one to develop a thorough understanding of robotic communication systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will:
- Understand why robots need communication middleware
- Recognize the evolution from ROS 1 to ROS 2
- Describe the core components of ROS 2 architecture (DDS, publishers, subscribers)
- Demonstrate basic understanding of node creation and communication patterns
- Explain how AI agents can control robot systems
- Have foundational knowledge of robot modeling concepts
