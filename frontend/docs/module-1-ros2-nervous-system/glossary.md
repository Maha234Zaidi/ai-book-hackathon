# Glossary of Terms - Robotic Communication Systems Module

This glossary provides standardized definitions for key terms used throughout the Robotic Communication Systems Education Module to ensure consistency and clarity.

## A

### Agent
A software component that performs tasks autonomously, often in response to environmental stimuli or commands.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

## D

### DDS (Data Distribution Service)
A middleware protocol and API standard for real-time publish-subscribe communication, used as the underlying communication layer in ROS 2.

## H

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with a human-like body structure, typically including a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## N

### Node
An independent process that performs computation in a robotic system. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of ROS programs.

## R

### Robot Model
A standardized format for representing robot models, defining physical components and relationships, typically using URDF.

### ROS (Robot Operating System)
A flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

### ROS 2
The second generation of the Robot Operating System, providing a collection of libraries and tools to help write robotic applications that address key issues for robotics, including scale, maintainability, security, and safety.

## S

### Service
A communication pattern that allows nodes to request information or actions from other nodes. A service consists of a request and a response.

### Subscriber
A node that receives messages from a topic in a publisher-subscriber communication pattern.

## T

### Topic
A named bus over which nodes exchange messages. Topics are used to broadcast information in a publisher-subscriber communication pattern.

## U

### URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
An XML format for representing robot models, including links, joints, and other robot properties.

## r

### rclpy
The Python library for ROS 2 that allows Python programs to interact with ROS 2. It provides the standard API for most ROS concepts.
