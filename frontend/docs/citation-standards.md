# Citation Standards for Robotics Documentation

## Overview

This document establishes the citation standards for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book. All sources must be properly cited following the IEEE format as specified in the project constitution.

## IEEE Citation Format

### General Guidelines

- Number citations consecutively in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2])
- Place citations at the end of the sentence before the period
- For multiple citations, use a range (e.g., [1]-[3]) or separate numbers (e.g., [1], [3], [5])

### Journal Articles

[Number] Author(s) first initial(s) and last name(s), "Title of article," Abbreviated Journal Name, vol. number, no. number, pp. first page-last page, Month Year, doi: 10.xxxx/xxxxx.

Example:
[1] S. Doe and J. Smith, "Advanced path planning for humanoid robots," IEEE Trans. Robot., vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 823-835, Aug. 2019, doi: 10.1109/TRO.2019.2924551.

### Conference Papers

[Number] Author(s) first initial(s) and last name(s), "Title of paper," in Proc. Abbreviated Conf. Name, City, Country, Year, pp. first page-last page.

Example:
[2] A. Johnson and B. Lee, "Real-time obstacle detection using deep learning," in Proc. IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. Intell. Robots Syst. (IROS), Madrid, Spain, 2018, pp. 2345-2352.

### Books

[Number] Author(first initial(s) and last name), Title of Book, Edition if not first, Publisher City, State/Country: Publisher Name, Year.

Example:
[3] M. W. Spong, S. Hutchinson, and M. Vidyasagar, Robot Modeling and Control, 2nd ed. New York, NY, USA: Wiley, 2020.

### Online Resources and Documentation

[Number] Author or Organization, "Title of webpage/document," Abbreviated Site Name. Year. [Medium]. Available: URL. [Accessed: Date].

Example:
[4] Open Robotics, "ROS 2 Documentation," ROS.org. 2023. [Online]. Available: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/. [Accessed: Dec. 9, 2025].

### Technical Reports

[Number] Author(first initial(s) and last name), "Title of report," Abbreviated Organization, Location, Report No., Year.

Example:
[5] R. Robot, "Gazebo simulation environment specifications," Open Source Robotics Foundation, Scottsdale, AZ, USA, Tech. Rep. OSRF-TR-2022-001, 2022.

## Specific Examples for Robotics Content

### ROS 2 Documentation Citations

For ROS 2 documentation references:
[6] ROS 2 Documentation, "Tutorials and User Guides," ROS.org. 2023. [Online]. Available: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html. [Accessed: Dec. 9, 2025].

### Research Paper Citations

For robotics research papers, include the DOI when available:
[7] X. Chen, Y. Wang, and Z. Liu, "Humanoid gait optimization using reinforcement learning," IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng., vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 2156-2167, July 2022, doi: 10.1109/TASE.2021.3118901.

### Standard Citations

For robotics and communication standards:
[8] Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, "IEEE Standard for Robot Vision Vocabulary," IEEE Std 1855-2013, pp. 1-28, Oct. 2013, doi: 10.1109/IEEESTD.2013.6687196.

## Application in Text

When referencing sources in the text:

- Use numbered citations [1]
- When referring to a specific aspect of a source, include the page or section: [2, pp. 2345-2352]
- For multiple citations that support the same point, use [1], [3], [5]
- When comparing multiple sources in a sentence, use [1]-[3]

## Important Notes

1. All sources cited must be verifiable and from credible sources (ROS docs, Gazebo docs, Isaac Sim docs, research papers, NVIDIA blogs, robotics textbooks, etc.)
2. URLs in citations should be valid and accessible
3. Access dates should be recent (within one year) for online sources
4. When referencing ROS 2 packages or features, cite the official ROS 2 documentation
5. For experimental results, cite the original research papers
6. For established robotics algorithms, cite the seminal papers as well as recent improvements
