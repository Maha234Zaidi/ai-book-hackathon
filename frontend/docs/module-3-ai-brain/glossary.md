# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key terms related to NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and other robotics technologies used in this module.

## A

**Apriltag**: A visual fiducial system consisting of a 2D barcode that can be detected and used for position and orientation estimation. Isaac ROS provides hardware-accelerated Apriltag detection.

## C

**CUDA**: A parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA. It allows software to use certain types of graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing.

## D

**Docker**: A set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: A communication standard for real-time systems defined by the Object Management Group (OMG). Used by ROS 2 for message passing between nodes.

## E

**Ecosystem**: The collection of tools, frameworks, and libraries that work together in the NVIDIA Isaac platform, including Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Isaac Apps, and Isaac ORBIT.

## G

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: A specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.

## H

**Hardware Acceleration**: The use of computer hardware specialized for a specific task to perform that task faster than it could be performed by general-purpose software running on a CPU.

## I

**Isaac Apps**: Reference applications that demonstrate how to implement complete robotics applications using the Isaac SDK.

**Isaac ORBIT**: A framework for training and deploying reinforcement learning models for robotics.

**Isaac ROS**: A collection of hardware-accelerated perception and navigation packages built on top of ROS 2.

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's reference application for robotics simulation based on NVIDIA Omniverse.

## L

**Linux**: A Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution.

## M

**Middleware**: Software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. In ROS 2, the middleware is based on DDS.

## N

**Nav2**: The navigation stack for ROS 2, providing path planning, path execution, and obstacle avoidance capabilities.

**NITROS (Network Interface for Time-sensitive, Real-time, and Optimized Semantics)**: A network interface for efficient data transmission in Isaac ROS.

## O

**Omniverse**: NVIDIA's simulation and collaboration platform based on Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) and NVIDIA RTX technology.

## P

**PhysX**: NVIDIA's real-time physics engine middleware SDK which simulates physics environments.

**Perception Pipeline**: A series of processing steps that convert sensor data into meaningful information about the environment.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A set of software libraries and tools that help build robot applications. The next generation of the Robot Operating System.

## S

**Simulation**: The process of creating a model of a real-world system and conducting experiments with the model to understand the behavior of the system.

**Synthetic Data**: Artificially generated data that mimics real-world data, often used for training machine learning models when real data is scarce or difficult to obtain.

## V

**VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technology that allows a device to track its location and orientation while simultaneously mapping its environment using visual sensors.

## W

**Watt**: A ROS 2 compatible robot model available in Isaac Sim for simulation.

**Workspace**: In ROS 2 context, a directory containing ROS 2 packages that are built and sourced together.
