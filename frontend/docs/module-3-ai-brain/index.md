# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book. This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac technologies, covering Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS, photorealistic simulation with synthetic data generation, VSLAM and navigation with hardware acceleration, path planning with Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement, and best practices for integrating perception, navigation, and simulation systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamentals of the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem including Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
2. Create photorealistic simulations with synthetic data generation and sensor integration
3. Implement Visual SLAM and navigation systems using hardware acceleration
4. Configure path planning for bipedal humanoid movement with obstacle avoidance using Nav2
5. Apply best practices for integrating perception, navigation, and simulation systems

## Module Structure

This module is divided into five main sections:

1. [Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac](./introduction-to-isaac/index.md) - Overview of Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS, applications
2. [Photorealistic Simulation](./photorealistic-simulation/index.md) - Synthetic data generation, sensor integration
3. [VSLAM and Navigation](./vslam-navigation/index.md) - Visual SLAM concepts, hardware acceleration
4. [Path Planning with Nav2](./nav2-path-planning/index.md) - Bipedal humanoid movement, obstacle avoidance
5. [Best Practices & Integration](./integration-best-practices/index.md) - Combining perception, navigation, simulation

Each section contains theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.
